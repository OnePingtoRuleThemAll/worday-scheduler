# User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## Description:
A simple day calendar to be utilized to help schedule out ones day by the hour and that will signify with the color of whether the scheudled time slot is past, present or future.


## Usage Instructions:
Simply go into the the scheduler and type in whatever you'd like to schedule into the time slot you'd like to scheduel it [!image](work-day-1.png)
Once you've typed in what you'd like, click on the blue button labeled "Log" [!image](work-day-save.png) to save your schedule
## Credits:
I relied heavily on looking up a lot of youtube videos on walkthroughs, as well as documentation on jQuery. I watched a walkthrough with Jack and Monica during afterclass Office Hours for updating the time for the day and hour (not sure if it's even firing correctly on that note)
