# User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event

## Credits
I watched a lot of youtube videos to try and understand the jQuery additions better (still have a long ways to go in that department) I also joined a breakout room and utitlized
some of what Jack was explaining to all of us while Monica was sharing her issues with us as a group.
